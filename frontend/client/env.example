# Environment Variables Example – Pyxis Next.js Frontend
# 
# Copy this file to `.env` in the root of the Next.js frontend project
# and adjust the values to match your deployment environment.
# The frontend reads these variables at build time (for NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
# and at runtime.

# URL of the backend API (Flask application) that the frontend will call.
# This should be the publicly accessible address of the backend server.
# In development, it might be http://localhost:5000.
# In production, it will be something like https://api.yourdomain.com.
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_BACKEND_API="http://localhost:5000"

# URL of the frontend itself (used for canonical links, OG meta tags, etc.).
# In development, it is usually http://localhost:3000.
# In production, set it to the public domain, e.g., https://search.yourdomain.com.
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_FRONTEND="http://localhost:3000"

# Additional environment variables can be added below.
# Remember that only variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are
# embedded in the browser bundle.
